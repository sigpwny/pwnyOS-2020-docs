# UIUCTF 2021
These docs were released with our first PwnyOS release last year. They are still mostly relevant to PwnyOS internals and are a good reference for the 2021 challenges. To connect to PwnyOS this year, follow the instructions on [uiuc.tf](https://uiuc.tf)!

# PwnyOS 2020 Documentation
This repo contains all documentation for the 2020 UIUCTF Kernel Exploitation challenge series.

If you see anything missing, or anything wrong, please send us a ModMail in the UIUCTF discord.

UIUCTF 2020's official main page can be found: [here](https://uiuc.tf)

# Connecting (2020)
To get started with your personal pwnyOS VM, grab your credentials from https://uiuc.tf/pwnyos

Your credentials will be a 4 digit number called a "Port" and a password. These define your unique VM.

To connect to your VM, you'll need a "VNC Client". We use RealVNC, but any VNC client will do. (Ubuntu ships with one called Remmina).

Once you've got your VNC client setup, you can connect to your VM with the following hostname:
`kernel.chal.uiuc.tf:PORT`, where PORT is your port we provided to you.

When prompted for your password, enter your password.

If you've got any questions at all, send us a ModMail in the UIUCTF 2020 Discord.

Good luck and happy hacking!
