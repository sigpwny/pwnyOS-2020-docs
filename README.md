This repo contains all documentation for the 2020 UIUCTF Kernel Exploitation challenge series.

# Connecting
To get started with your personal pwnyOS VM, first check your inbox for your credentials.
If you didn't hear from us, send us a ModMail in the UIUCTF Discord.

Your credentials will be a 4 digit number called a "Port" and a password. These define your unique VM.

To connect to your VM, you'll need a "VNC Client". We use RealVNC, but any VNC client will do. (Ubuntu ships with one called Remmina).

Once you've got your VNC client setup, you can connect to your VM with the following hostname:
`kernel.chal.uiuc.tf:PORT`, where PORT is your port we provided to you.

When prompted for your password, enter your password.

If you've got any questions at all, send us a ModMail in the UIUCTF 2020 Discord.

Good luck and happy hacking!
